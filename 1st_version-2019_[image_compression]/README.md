# TI_Project-Compression_Of_Images

- [x] Finished

## Description:
In 2020 it was asked to do a study of some algorithms of compression applied on images vs the algorithm of PNG.<br>
(Honestly this version is a sh**, if you want some interesting compression go to version of 2021)

## To run this project:
[WARNING] Python 3.9 and the libraries refered must be installed <br>
This files .py act separately so:
- Deflate.py<br>
  Put name of the file that you want to compress on the first *with open(*<br>
  Put name of the file that you want to give to save compressed data on the second *with open(*<br>
  (for decompression you have to use the variable *dados* used on compression and put the name of the file that you want to decompress on *with open(*<br>
- RleFunc.py<br>
  This file works as a import, you can use the same steps that we use on *Deflate.py*<br>
  (decompression was not made)<br>
- Huffman.py<br>
  You can use the same steps that we use on *Deflate.py*<br>
  (decompression was not made)
